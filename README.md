## Datavis Final

### Reading the dataset:
Each row in the dataset represents an individual county. We don't seem to have data on every county in the US, but we've got 1574 of them.
The 'County Code' column contains the FIPS county code of a county.
The 'Population' column contains the 2016 estimated population from the [USDA population estimates](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/county-level-data-sets/download-data/) dataset.
Each remaining column represents one of the ICD-10 113 selected causes of death, coded in 'death codes.txt', and the number in the row is the number of deaths in the county in 2016 due to that cause.
